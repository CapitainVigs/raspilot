    // PID controllers.
    
    // There are three sorts of PID controllers in raspilot. The first sort consists of two pid controllers named PidX and PidY.
    // They are used to translate target ground velocity to relative velocity w.r.t. to the air speed.
    // They allow to fly in windy conditions. Values [1,0,0] define identical translation.
    // It is perfectly OK to use values [1,0,0] for non-windy weather, flying in interior or during the calibration of the drone.
    // You configure the same values for both PidX and PidY controllers.

    // pidXY:        { p:1.00,  i:009,  d:0.0009 },
    pidXY:        { p:0.9,  i:0.05,  d:0.0001 },

    // The second sort of PID controllers translates the desired drone roll pitch yaw rotation to motor thrust
    // (i.e. to a value between 0 and 1). That are PidRoll, PidPitch and PidYaw controllers.
    // The "Integral" part of those controlers accumulates value representing unbalancing of the drone or its motors.
    // It is supposed that during a flight, the Integral part will accumulate the same value for the same drone
    // no matter the flight conditions. However, under some circumstances the Interal part of roll and pitch may "push"
    // against pidX and pidY controllers and all those controllers may diverge.
    // This is why we suppose to set the I factor to zero for roll and pitch PIDs and we allow to use a so
    // called "constant integral" value "CI" representing the average I*Integral specific to your drone.

#define RPB 0.12

    pidYaw:      { p:0.2,  i:0.1,  d:0.00001, ci: 0 },

    // The last sort of PID controller is pidAltitude. It translates desired vertical speed (usually 0)
    // to motor thrust. It shall have P factor large enough to launch and stabilize the drone altitude.
    // Similarly to previous controllers you can use CI constant to start PID rotation at some previously
    // determined constant value. Contrary to previous controllers you shall keep the I factor non zero in this
    // controller even if CI is set. The I factor in this case accumulates the difference between fully
    // charged and "nearly empty" batteries.
